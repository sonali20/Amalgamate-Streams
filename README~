Given n streams of integers in increasing order, the class 'amalgamatedStreams' (derived from 'minStream') generates a combined stream of integers in increasing order. 

tester.cpp is written to test the class.

Build command - 
g++ -std=c++11 -o tester tester.cpp ./src/amalgamatedStream.cpp ./src/inputMinStream.cpp -I ./include

Run command - 
./tester
